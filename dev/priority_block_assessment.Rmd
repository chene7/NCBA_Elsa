# Purpose
Provide and understanding of the characteristics of landscapes within priority 
blocks versus all landscapes within North Carolina.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE)

library(sf)
starttime <- Sys.time()

comma <- function(x) format(x, digits=2, big.mark=",")
```

```{r block_data}
# Read in NCBA block spatial data frame
blocks_path <- "~/Data/ncba_blocks.shp"
blocks_sf <- st_read(blocks_path)

# We need to assign the crs to the blocks since none is in metadata, I asked 
# John Carpenter for which crs it is in.
st_crs(blocks_sf) = 6542
```

```{r}
plot(blocks_sf$TYPE)
```
