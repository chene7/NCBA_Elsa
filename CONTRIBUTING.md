Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome from the community. Questions can be asked on the
[issues page][1]. Before creating a new issue, please take a moment to search
and make sure a similar issue does not already exist. If one does exist, you
can comment (most simply even with just a `:+1:`) to show your support for that
issue.

If you would like to contribute, fork this repository, clone it to you local
machine, make edits, push to your fork/repo, and submit a pull request.

At this time, the greatest contribution you can make is to install and
give feedback to the maintainer.

Task Management
==================

Individual tasks should be identified and described as individual issues so that they can be monitored and organized easily via github projects.  Avoid grouping multiple tasks into a single issue unless they are closely related.  Detailed elaboration and discussion of issues is encouraged.  

Once created, tasks (issues) can be labeled as "wish", "to do", "in progress", or "done" in the NCBA Code Development project or another project.  Tasks should also be either claimed or assigned to an individual once they reach the "to do" phase.
